# NCS_LLM_MySQL_DB
This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database. User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database.

**Project Highlights**

 a t shirt store that sells Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen and Levi's t shirts

Their inventory, sales and discounts data is stored in a MySQL database
We will build an LLM based question and answer system that will use following,
Google Palm LLM
Hugging face embeddings
Streamlit for UI
Langchain framework
Chromadb as a vector store
Few shot learning
In the UI, store manager will ask questions in a natural language and it will produce the answers
