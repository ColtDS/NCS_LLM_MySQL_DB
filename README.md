# NCS_LLM_MySQL_DB
This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database. User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and then executing that query on MySQL database.
